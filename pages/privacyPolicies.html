                    Personal information collected through our Platforms may be shared between the brands and affiliates, including future affiliates that are owned or operated by Luxottica of America Inc.
                    
                    We also share personal information with selected third parties for their own marketing purposes (except for your phone number or biometric information). This also includes information collected through pixels and other tracking technologies operated by third parties, as described elsewhere in this Policy. See the “Your Choices” section of this Policy for more information.
                    
                    We may release personal information if we believe in good faith that: (1) the law or legal process requires it; (2) we have received a valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency; or (3) such release is necessary or appropriate (in our sole discretion) to protect the rights, property, or safety of Luxottica, or any of our respective affiliates, service providers, customers, or (4) as Luxottica deems necessary to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, prevent fraud and otherwise enforce the Terms of Use..
                    
                    We may also share your information with your consent or as otherwise disclosed at the time of data collection or sharing.
                    
                    As with any business, it is possible that as our business develops, we might go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or the sale of all or a portion of our assets, or buying online stores or other assets, including at bankruptcy. In such transactions, information about customers will likely be transferred.
                    
                    The Platforms may allow you to provide comments in various sections of our Platforms, such as in product reviews. Please be aware that the information you post in these areas may be available to visitors of the Platforms and to the general public. To the fullest extent allowed under applicable law, we do not monitor such content and are not responsible for material posted by you or others in these public forums.

We also may share technical information, such as the number of users who visited the Platforms during a specific time period or who purchased a specific product through the Platforms, with our marketing service providers, advertisers, and others from time to time. This information generally is shared in an aggregated form.
                    
                    We are a multi-national organization with locations in many countries around the world. Your personal information may be stored and processed outside of your country, province or state of residence, in any jurisdiction where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, to the extent allowed in accordance with applicable law. This means that your personal information may be transferred in jurisdictions that have less restrictive privacy laws than your country, province, or state of residence, in which case we will ensure, through contractual means or otherwise, that it will receive an adequate protection in compliance with generally accepted data protection principles. We take steps to process personal information according to the provisions of this Privacy Policy and the requirements of applicable law.
                    
                    <span>DIGITAL ADVERTISING & ANALYTICS</span>
                    


                    We may partner with ad networks and other ad serving providers (“Advertising Providers”) that serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated platforms. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information Advertising Providers collect about your use of the Platforms and other sites or apps over time, including information about relationships among different browsers and devices.
                    
                    This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising and works to use your information to make ads more useful to you. You may visit www.aboutads.info to learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt out of this advertising on websites by companies participating in the DAA self-regulatory program. If you delete your cookies or use a different browser or mobile device, you may need to renew your opt out choices exercised through the DAA tool. Note that electing to opt out will not stop advertisements from appearing in your browser or applications. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. Additionally, your browser may offer tools to limit the use of cookies o r to delete cookies; however, if you use these tools, our Platforms may not function as intended.
                    
                    Advertising Providers may use data collected in connection with our advertising campaigns for the following purposes:
                    
                    For measurement and insight reporting (to produce and provide us with reports measuring the impact and performance of our advertising campaigns). 
                    To produce benchmarking reports to share with their other customers, but such benchmarking reports will not identify you. 
                    To target our ad campaigns to specific groups of individuals having particular characteristics. 
                    To improve and optimize advertising services (for example, to support the objectives of our ad campaigns, improve the effectiveness of their own advertising services and determine the relevance of ads to individuals). 
                    To personalize ads that the Advertizing Providers show, including to enhance user profiles with inferred interests.
                    For their internal purposes, including (i) to promote and ensure the safety and security on and of their products and services; (ii) to detect and prevent malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, invalid or illegal activity; (iii) for research and development purposes; and (iv) to maintain the integrity of and to improve their products and services.
                    To combine it with  other data collected by Advertising Providers in order to provide greater  insights in respect of our advertisements.
                    We may also work with service providers that collect data about your use of the Sites and other sites or apps over time for non-advertising purposes subject to their privacy policies. We use analytics providers such as Google Analytics to gather and analyze aggregated anonymous user information. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. You can opt out of Google’s collection and processing of data generated by your use of the Sites by going to http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
                    
                    We use web analytics tools to enhance user experience by optimizing the efficiency, design, and quality of the Platforms. Our analytics tools use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information related to user behavioral metrics on the Platforms, such as mouse movements, clicks, user inputs, scrolling, access time, visit duration, pages viewed, IP address (including approximate location), operating system, and page reloading. These tools provide insight into what works and what doesn’t work for users of the Platforms and they allow us to, for example, identify and repair technical errors such as broken links that impair the Platforms’ functionality. The web analytics tools also help us reconstruct the user experience to better understand, for example, where users may be encountering frustration or impediments to using the Platforms. 
                    
                    We use a website analytics tool that provides session replay, heatmaps, funnels, form analytics, feedback campaigns, and similar features/functionality. This session replay software may record your clicks, mouse movements, scrolling, form fills (keystrokes) in non-excluded fields, pages visited and content, time on site, browser, operating system, device type (desktop/tablet/phone), screen resolution, visitor type (first time/returning), anonymized IP address, location (city/country), language, and similar metadata. This software does not collect information on pages where it is not installed, nor does it track or collect information outside your web browser. 
                    
                    We use this web-based analytics software because it gives us a tool to track the online behavior of visitors while on the Platforms and lets us replay visitors’ actions. This tool gives us the opportunity to make the Platforms better and, in turn, provide you with an enhanced online experience as well. Thanks to this tool, we are able to gain insight on how you and other visitors use the Platforms; for example, whether you can easily locate the “Find a Store” page or whether it takes multiple clicks to get to that page. Information about these small choices and interactions are of paramount value to us, as they can easily make your experience better and more intuitive and, more importantly, allow us to provide you with a more seamless, customer-friendly e-shopping experience while on the Platforms. 
                    
                    For more information on this session replay software, see Contentsquare’s Privacy Policy at https://contentsquare.com/privacy-center/privacy-policy/. 
                    
                    We may use pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) to, among other things, track the actions of users of the Services (including email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and compile statistics About usage of the services and response rates. Our Advertising Providers may use pixel tags to collect information for the purposes described above.
                    
                    <span>THIRD-PARTY LINKS & PLUG-IN</span>
                    
                    

                    The Platforms may provide links to third-party websites or apps, including our social media pages. We do not control the privacy practices of those websites or apps, and they are not covered by this Policy. You should review the privacy policies of other websites or apps that you use to learn about their data practices.
                    
                    The Platforms may also include integrated social media tools or “plug-ins,” such as social networking tools offered by third parties. If you use these tools to share information or you otherwise interact with social media features on the Platforms, those social media companies may collect information about you and may use and share such information in accordance with their own policies, including by sharing such information with us or the general public. Your interactions with third-party social media companies and the use of their features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide those features. We encourage you to read the privacy policies for any social media accounts you create and use.

                    Any collection of biometric identifiers and biometric information are for the sole purpose of assisting you in viewing how certain eyeglasses may look on your facial features. We will not disclose or disseminate any biometric information to any entity, other than those contracted parties that assist us in providing this service to you, or as  required by applicable federal, state or local law, or required pursuant to a valid warrant or subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.
                    
                    We will not share your biometric identifiers and biometric information with any entity except in the following cases:
                    
                    We will share your biometric identifiers and biometric information with contacted parties that assist us in providing services to you via our Platforms
